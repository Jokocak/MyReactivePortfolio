                CoffeeMaker is a fullstack coffee order management web application developed in a collaborative team setting. The project enables users to create, modify, view, and delete coffee orders, manage recipes, and simulate day-to-day caf√© operations. Designed to streamline the workflow of baristas and customers alike, CoffeeMaker features a user-friendly interface and robust backend logic.

                Working as part of an agile team, we implemented comprehensive CRUD operations and built RESTful API endpoints for seamless interaction between the frontend and backend. This enabled reliable management of coffee orders and recipes, and brought a scalable, maintainable architecture to the project. The application provides real-time feedback and a streamlined ordering experience.

                <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                <p>
                During this project, I strengthened my skills in fullstack development and deepened my understanding of REST API construction using Spring Boot. I also gained practical experience working with a team using version control (Git), code reviews, and agile methodologies. The project reinforced the value of clear communication, modular design, and best practices in developing production-ready web applications.
